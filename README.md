# Augnos Link Tree

Technologies used: Python, Flask, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, AWS EC2. 

My first deployed website, a Linktree-style clone built with Python and Flask, and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance.

The purpose of this project was creating an actual website I will use and continually update. As a freelancer, I will continue to add new links to photo albums from concerts and parties I photograph, music events I'll be promoting and/or performing at, and any other valuable links involving my involvement in the music scene.

The other purpose of this project was to use a simple app to learn how to deploy projects to AWS EC2. I used Github to clone the repo (https://github.com/Augnos/augnos_linktree), and will continually pull to the server instance as I update the page with more links.

Challenges with this project included getting the site online as a Flask app instead of just an HTML page and some images. Another challenge was creating and directing a subdomain to my server instance. Lastly acquiring and installing SSL certification was the final challenge, and I was able to obtain a certificate and properly configure NGINX to handle the traffic to HTTPS.

This experience was a lot more challenging than I anticipated, but the knowledge I picked up with deploying such a simple site has been very insightful, and will help me with deploying upcoming projects.
