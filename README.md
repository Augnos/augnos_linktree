# [LinkTree Clone](https://go.augnos.com)

Technologies used: Python, Flask, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, AWS EC2. 

My first deployed website, a Linktree-style clone built with Python and Flask, and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance.

The purpose of this project was creating an actual website I will use and continually update. As a freelancer, I will continue to add new links to photo albums from concerts and parties I photograph, music events I'll be promoting and/or performing at, and any other valuable links involving my involvement in the music scene.

The other purpose of this project was to use a simple app to learn how to deploy projects to AWS EC2. I cloned this repo to the instance, and will add and update links indefinitel.

Challenges with this project included getting the site online as a Flask app instead of just an HTML page and some images. Another challenge was creating and directing a subdomain to my server instance. Lastly acquiring and installing SSL certification was the final challenge, and I was able to obtain a certificate and properly configure NGINX to handle the traffic to HTTPS.

Deploying to AWS was more challenging than I anticipated, but has paved the way for other deployments to go a lot more smoothly. I've been able to even help some of my cohortmates with their own deployments and acquiring SSL certificates for their own projects.
