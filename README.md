# [LinkTree Clone](https://go.augnos.com)

Technologies used: Python, Flask, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, AWS EC2. 

This application was created as a clone of a Linktree repository. Linktrees are used for social media profiles where typically only 1 link is allowed to be presented, such as Twitter and Instagram. Linktrees get around that limitation by presenting a simple website that hosts multiple important links for the user to share with visitors.

This was my first application, and I'm actively using it to this day. My brand, Augnos, revolves around music and photography, and I update my "Linktree clone" regularly with photos and shows.

As the first application I'd complete, I wanted to build something I would actually use, while also learning how to deploy and update a web application to be viewed anywhere on the internet. Building this app introduced me to working with Amazon Web Services, EC2 instances, SSL Certificates, and web servers like NGINX.
